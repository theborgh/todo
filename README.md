# Todo App in TypeScript

This is a simple Todo app written in TypeScript. It allows you to add and remove items from a todo list.

## Installation

To install the app, clone this repository and then run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
npm install

## Usage

To run the app, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000, where you can view and interact with the app.

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the app in the `dist` directory.
